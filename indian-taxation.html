        <h2>Introduction to Indian Taxation System</h2>
        <p>India’s tax system is governed by the <strong>Income Tax Act, 1961</strong>, which outlines the taxation framework for both direct and indirect taxes. The central government administers <strong>direct taxes</strong> like income tax, while <strong>indirect taxes</strong> like GST are governed by the state and central governments. The system is progressive, meaning taxes are based on the individual's income level.</p>
