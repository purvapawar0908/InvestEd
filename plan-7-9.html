        <h2>Investment Plans</h2>
        <h3>Equity-Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS)</h3>
        <p>For individuals in the ₹7 lakh to ₹9 lakh income range, investing in ELSS offers tax deduction benefits under Section 80C, along with the potential for higher returns. With a 3-year lock-in period, ELSS is ideal for long-term wealth creation while reducing tax liability.</p>

        <h3>National Pension Scheme (NPS)</h3>
        <p>Contribute to the National Pension Scheme (NPS) to reduce taxable income and plan for retirement. Deduction of up to ₹1.5 lakh is available under Section 80C, with an additional ₹50,000 available under Section 80CCD(1B) for NPS contributions, making it an excellent tax-saving tool.</p>

        <h2>Other Tax Savings</h2>
        <h3>Health Insurance Premiums</h3>
        <p>Health insurance is a vital investment for both your well-being and tax savings. Deduct premiums paid for yourself and your family under Section 80D. This helps in lowering taxable income while securing health coverage for the future.</p>

        <h3>Home Loan Interest</h3>
        <p>If you have a home loan, don’t forget to claim deductions on the interest paid under Section 24. This can help reduce your tax burden while also aiding in property ownership and long-term wealth creation.</p>
