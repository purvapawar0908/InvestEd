        <h2>Income Level: ₹10 Lakh - ₹12 Lakh</h2>
        <p><strong>Tax Tip:</strong> Advanced Tax Planning. Your income falls into the 20% tax bracket, so it’s crucial to maximize deductions and exemptions.</p>
        <p>With an income of ₹10 Lakh to ₹12 Lakh, you are in the 20% tax bracket. This income level requires careful planning to minimize tax liability. Focus on maximizing deductions under Section 80C and exploring other options like NPS and health insurance premiums. Tax-saving strategies will help reduce your overall tax burden and secure your financial future.</p>

        <h2>Investment Plans</h2>
        <h3>Tax-Saving Fixed Deposits</h3>
        <p>The interest earned is taxable, but they provide immediate tax relief under Section 80C, making them a good option for quick tax-saving.</p>

        <h3>ELSS Mutual Funds</h3>
        <p>For those willing to take more risk for higher returns, ELSS mutual funds are an excellent option to save taxes while also growing wealth.</p>

        <h2>Other Tax Saving Options</h2>
        <h3>National Pension Scheme (NPS) & Public Provident Fund (PPF)</h3>
        <p>Contributing to both the National Pension Scheme (NPS) and the Public Provident Fund (PPF) will help you build your retirement corpus while availing tax deductions. NPS offers additional tax benefits beyond the ₹1.5 lakh limit under Section 80C.</p>

        <h3>Education Loan Deduction (80E)</h3>
        <p>If you’ve taken a loan for higher education, the interest on this loan is deductible under Section 80E, helping reduce your taxable income.</p>
