        <p><strong>Tax Tip:</strong> Increase Investments in Tax-Saving Instruments</p>
        <p>For individuals earning between ₹6 lakh and ₹7 lakh, you will be taxed at a 5% rate on income above ₹2.5 lakh. To minimize your tax liability, it's essential to increase your investments in various tax-saving instruments available under Sections 80C and 80D. These instruments not only help in reducing taxes but also enable you to build wealth over time.</p>

        <h2>Tax Saving Options</h2>
        <h3>Tax-Saving Mutual Funds (ELSS)</h3>
        <p>Equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS) offer tax benefits under <strong>Section 80C</strong> and come with a 3-year lock-in period. ELSS funds are ideal for those looking for higher returns over the long term. They are suitable for individuals with a moderate-to-high risk appetite.</p>

        <h3>Home Loan Interest Deduction (Section 24(b))</h3>
        <p>If you have a home loan, you can claim a deduction on the interest paid under <strong>Section 24(b)</strong> up to ₹2 lakh, provided the loan is for the purchase or construction of a residential property. This is an excellent option to reduce your taxable income while paying for your home.</p>
