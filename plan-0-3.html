        <h2>Income Level: ₹0 - ₹3 Lakh</h2>
        <p><strong>Tax Tip:</strong> Utilize the Basic Exemption Limit</p>
        <p>For individuals earning up to ₹3 lakh, no income tax is payable due to the basic exemption limit of ₹2.5 lakh. However, if you're earning slightly above ₹2.5 lakh, you should look into tax-saving options to reduce your taxable income further.</p>

        <h2>Investment Plans</h2>
        <h3>Public Provident Fund (PPF)</h3>
        <p>This is an excellent long-term tax-saving tool. Contributions to PPF qualify for a deduction under <strong>Section 80C</strong> (up to ₹1.5 lakh). The interest earned is tax-free, and the maturity proceeds are also exempt from tax.</p>
        
        <h3>National Savings Certificate (NSC)</h3>
        <p>You can invest in NSC under <strong>Section 80C</strong>. It provides a fixed interest rate, and the interest earned is taxable, but you can claim a tax deduction for the principal and interest under 80C and 80C(2) respectively.</p>

        <h2>Other Options</h2>
        <h3>Health Insurance (Section 80D)</h3>
        <p>If you're under 60 years of age, you can claim a deduction of up to ₹25,000 for premiums paid for health insurance policies. For senior citizens (above 60 years), the limit increases to ₹50,000.</p>
