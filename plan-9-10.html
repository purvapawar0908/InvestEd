        <h2>Income Level: ₹9 Lakh - ₹10 Lakh</h2>
        <p><strong>Tax Tip:</strong> Use Section 80D and 80G for More Savings</p>
        <p>If your income is between ₹9 lakh and ₹10 lakh, you will be taxed at 20% on income above ₹10 lakh. To optimize your tax liability, you should focus on investments that provide both long-term returns and significant tax-saving benefits. The following instruments and deductions can help reduce your taxable income.</p>

        <h2>Investment Plans</h2>
        <h3>PPF and EPF</h3>
        <p>Public Provident Fund (PPF) and Employee Provident Fund (EPF) are low-risk, government-backed investment options that offer tax-free returns. Contributions to both of these plans qualify for a tax deduction under Section 80C, thus helping to reduce your taxable income.</p>

        <h3>NPS Contributions</h3>
        <p>Contributions to the National Pension System (NPS) are eligible for a tax deduction under Section 80C. Additionally, contributions to NPS under <strong>Section 80CCD(1B)</strong> allow for an extra tax deduction of up to ₹50,000, over and above the ₹1.5 lakh limit under Section 80C.</p>

        <h2>Health and Education Savings</h2>
        <h3>Section 80G Donations</h3>
        <p>Donations made to approved charitable institutions and NGOs are eligible for a tax deduction under Section 80G. The deduction can be either 50% or 100%, depending on the organization. This is a great way to not only reduce taxes but also contribute to a good cause.</p>
