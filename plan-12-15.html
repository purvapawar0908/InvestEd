        <p><strong>Tax Tip:</strong> Optimize Deductions for High-Income Earners</p>
        <p>Your income falls under the 20% tax bracket, so tax planning is key. By utilizing appropriate tax-saving options, you can minimize your taxable income and effectively reduce your overall tax liability. Make the most of tax-saving investments and other deductions that will lower your taxable income.</p>

        <h2>Investment Plans</h2>
        <h3>Equity-Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS)</h3>
        <p>ELSS is a great option to reduce taxes under Section 80C, as these investments allow for deductions while providing the potential for high returns. The 3-year lock-in period makes it a good choice for long-term planning.</p>

        <h3>National Pension Scheme (NPS)</h3>
        <p>Contributing to the NPS not only helps in retirement planning but also provides an additional ₹50,000 deduction under Section 80CCD(1B), along with the Section 80C limit of ₹1.5 lakh. It’s a great way to save tax and invest for the future.</p>

        <h2>Other Tax Savings</h2>
        <h3>Tax-Saving Fixed Deposits & PPF</h3>
        <p>Ensure that you fully utilize the ₹1.5 lakh limit under Section 80C by investing in safe options like Tax-Saving Fixed Deposits and the Public Provident Fund (PPF), both of which provide reliable returns and tax benefits.</p>

        <h3>Health Insurance Premiums (80D)</h3>
        <p>Investing in health insurance not only secures your family but also allows you to claim deductions on premiums paid under Section 80D. If you have senior citizens in your family, the deduction limit increases, providing additional tax savings.</p>
