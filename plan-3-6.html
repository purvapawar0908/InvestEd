        <p><strong>Tax Tip:</strong> Avail of the Basic Exemption + Section 80C Deductions</p>
        <p>For individuals earning between ₹3 lakh and ₹6 lakh, you will be taxed at a 5% rate on income above ₹2.5 lakh. To minimize your tax liability, you should utilize tax-saving options like Section 80C deductions and additional deductions for the National Pension Scheme (NPS).</p>

        <p>Contributions to NPS qualify for a tax deduction of up to ₹50,000 under <strong>Section 80CCD(1B)</strong>, over and above the ₹1.5 lakh limit under Section 80C. This is a great way to reduce taxable income while saving for retirement.</p>

        <h3>Tax-Saving Fixed Deposits</h3>
        <p>These fixed deposits have a 5-year lock-in period and qualify for deductions under <strong>Section 80C</strong>. They offer a fixed return and a secure investment option.</p>
